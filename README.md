# Personal Travel Blog

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, designed as a personal travel blog with a custom homepage layout. The project features a responsive design with a story box, category section, and navigation elements, all aligned according to specific design instructions.

## Features
- **Homepage Layout**: Includes a header with a 3-bar menu icon, search icon, and centered title ("Personal Travel Blog"), a story box aligned with the 3-bar menu icon, and an "Explore by Category" section with 6 customizable cubes.
- **Category Section**: Displays 6 cubes (180x180px) with 16px gaps, scrollable via left and right arrows, with the 6th cube's right edge aligned vertically with the right arrow.
- **Story Box**: Positioned at the bottom of the header image, with its left edge aligned with the 3-bar menu icon, containing a title, excerpt, and "READ MORE" button.
- **Responsive Design**: Centered content with equal 80px margins on both sides.
